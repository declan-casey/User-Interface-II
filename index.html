        <h2>Introducing My Site</h2>
        <p>I was born in New Jersey, and moved to Florida when I was only one year old. We lived in the keys for the next eight. Our life there was far from average, between fishing, go-karting, parasailing etc. We moved to southwest Florida when I was about nine. I spent the next eleven years of my life there.</p>
        <p>I started going to college there at FGCU, and found that wasn't taking me anywhere I wanted to be. Right when I started thinking like that, my friend came to me telling me about Lambda. I watched him go through the data course program and started trying to self teach. Eventually I decided that I wanted to take it more seriously and I signed up for the Web Development program.</p>

            <p>These are some words that I am going to edit. I just need enough of them here for it to look good. I think an explanation point will look good at the end here!</p>
